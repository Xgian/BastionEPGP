# Modifed BastionEPGP for <Handle It> guild on Mankrik (Classic)
This version was made to allow easier use of RollPlus features. We added the ability to import a CSV of reserves directly into
BastionEPGP and including players that are not currently in the raid. We originally used a Google Sheets document to generate
the CSV. A sample can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ptM-RBIjtXawoc7oQZxSyBd5JXfPxmU1XXVA7-Dxoi0/edit?usp=sharing).

# BastionEPGP
In-game EPGP guild helper, supports standby, main/alt shared pools, minEP, offpecGP. Fixed price list with progress multiplier.
v2.x and onwards also offers a plusroll mode (toggle-able from minimap right-click menu or `/bepgp mode` chat command)
